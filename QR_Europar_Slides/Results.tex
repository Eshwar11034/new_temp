	\begin{block}{The Goal of Our Experiments}
		We conducted a series of experiments to answer three key questions:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item How do we find the optimal task granularity ($\alpha, \beta$)?
			\item How does our two-queue scheduler scale compared to the barrier scheduling?
			\item What is the final, end-to-end impact on the SLSQP solver?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}

	\begin{alertblock}{Implementation \& Configurations}
		We used Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library for scheduling.
		\vspace{1mm}
		
		We evaluate two primary configurations of our scheduler:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Without Priority:} Uses TBB's "concurrent\_queue". Tasks are processed in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.
			\item \textbf{With Priority:} Uses TBB's "concurrent\_priority\_queue". Tasks on the critical path are assigned higher priority to be executed sooner.
		\end{itemize}
