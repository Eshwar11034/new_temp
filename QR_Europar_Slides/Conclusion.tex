		\begin{block}{What We Achieved}
		  \begin{itemize}
		    \item Modeled the sequential QR algorithm as a task-based DAG to expose parallelism.
		    \item Designed a novel, asynchronous two-queue scheduler to execute the DAG without barriers.
		    \item Integrated our high-performance parallel QR into the NLOPT SLSQP solver.
		    \item Demonstrated a \textbf{>15x end-to-end speedup} on large-scale problems.
		  \end{itemize}

  \begin{alertblock}{Overall Impact}
    \centering
    Our work delivers a lightweight, open-source scheduler that significantly accelerates SLSQP for the common, medium-sized workloads where performance is most critical.
